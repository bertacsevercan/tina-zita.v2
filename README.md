## We won 3'rd place in the Impact HUB Istanbul Innovation Hackathon with M.Y-Inventory!

## Description

M.Y-Inventory is an Inventory Management System that contains user-friendly modules which are Admin Dashboard, Inventory, Orders, Recipes, and Tutorials with 3 different language supports and fully responsive across all devices featuring different use cases for mobile use.
The system helps Tina-Zita to manage their inventory and it's restricted outside of the organization.
It tracks the remaining amount when order is received and adds amount when something is added to stock.
The admin can see some additional features in Admin-Dashboard like trending recipes, expiring products, products out of stock, today's orders, notes
and monthly summary of their business.
The order tab helps the user to add new orders they received and all orders they have had throughout the day. When a new order is added,
the ingredients for the orders are automatically subtracted from the inventory.
In the recipes section, admin can collect their recipes, can add/edit new recipes with a form that is specialized for adding necessary ingredients separately.
Lastly, the tutorials tab offers detailed explanations about the system for our users.
## We plan to improve M.Y-Inventory in the future with:
- Different user access rights.
- Improvements on the admin dashboard. E.g. charts, graphs, summary of other modules.
- Messaging feature within the system with other users in the organization.
- Processing the orders automatically from the organizationâ€™s website.
- Predicting future inventory status using machine learning.

Currently M.Y-Inventory can only be accessed through authorized accounts.

We are looking for investors for further development.
